### Easy-1. Actors who cooperated with Directors atleast three times
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, HAVING

**Problem:**
```
Table: ActorDirector

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key column for this table.
 

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor have cooperated with the director at least 3 times.

Example:

ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select actor_id, director_id
from actordirector
group by actor_id, director_id
having count(*)>=3
```

### Easy-2. Ads performance
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery, CASE WHEN, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Ads

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| ad_id         | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| action        | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
(ad_id, user_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of an Ad, the ID of a user and the action taken by this user regarding this Ad.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('Clicked', 'Viewed', 'Ignored').
 

A company is running Ads and wants to calculate the performance of each Ad.

Performance of the Ad is measured using Click-Through Rate (CTR) where:



Write an SQL query to find the ctr of each Ad.

Round ctr to 2 decimal points. Order the result table by ctr in descending order and by ad_id in ascending order in case of a tie.

The query result format is in the following example:

Ads table:
+-------+---------+---------+
| ad_id | user_id | action  |
+-------+---------+---------+
| 1     | 1       | Clicked |
| 2     | 2       | Clicked |
| 3     | 3       | Viewed  |
| 5     | 5       | Ignored |
| 1     | 7       | Ignored |
| 2     | 7       | Viewed  |
| 3     | 5       | Clicked |
| 1     | 4       | Viewed  |
| 2     | 11      | Viewed  |
| 1     | 2       | Clicked |
+-------+---------+---------+
Result table:
+-------+-------+
| ad_id | ctr   |
+-------+-------+
| 1     | 66.67 |
| 3     | 50.00 |
| 2     | 33.33 |
| 5     | 0.00  |
+-------+-------+
for ad_id = 1, ctr = (2/(2+1)) * 100 = 66.67
for ad_id = 2, ctr = (1/(1+2)) * 100 = 33.33
for ad_id = 3, ctr = (1/(1+1)) * 100 = 50.00
for ad_id = 5, ctr = 0.00, Note that ad_id = 5 has no clicks or views.
Note that we don't care about Ignored Ads.
Result table is ordered by the ctr. in case of a tie we order them by ad_id
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select ad_id, sum(case when action in ('Clicked') then 1 else 0 end) as clicked
from ads
group by ad_id
)

, t2 as
(
Select ad_id as ad, sum(case when action in ('Clicked','Viewed') then 1 else 0 end) as total
from ads
group by ad_id
)

Select a.ad_id, coalesce(round((clicked +0.0)/nullif((total +0.0),0)*100,2),0) as ctr
from
(
select *
from t1 join t2
on t1.ad_id = t2.ad) a
order by ctr desc, ad_id
```

### Easy-3. Article views
**Concepts tested:** Basic SELECT / Aggregation

**Problem:**
```
Table: Views

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 

Write an SQL query to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles, sorted in ascending order by their id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |

| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Result table:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 4    |
| 7    |
+------+
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select distinct author_id as id
from views
where author_id = viewer_id
order by author_id
```

### Easy-4. Average selling price
**Concepts tested:** JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Prices

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

Table: UnitsSold

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units and product_id of each product sold. 
 

Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product.

average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |

+------------+------------+------------+--------+
 
UnitsSold table:
+------------+---------------+-------+
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
+------------+---------------+-------+
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+

Result table:
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select d.product_id, round((sum(price*units)+0.00)/(sum(units)+0.00),2) as average_price
from(
Select *
from prices p
natural join 
unitssold u
where u.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date) d
group by d.product_id
```

from Person P left join Address A
on P.PersonId = A.PersonId
```

### Easy-9. Consecutive available seats
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, Subquery, LAG/LEAD

**Problem:**
```
Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

My Solution
//METHOD 1
SELECT DISTINCT c1.seat_id
FROM cinema c1
JOIN cinema c2 ON ABS(c1.seat_id - c2.seat_id) = 1
Where c1.free = 1 AND c2.free = 1

//METHOD 2
SELECT c1.seat_id
 FROM cinema c1
 JOIN cinema c2 on c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id - 1
 where c1.free = 1 AND c2.free = 1
 
UNION
 
SELECT c2.seat_id
 FROM cinema c1
 JOIN cinema c2 on  c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id + 1
 where c1.free = 1 AND c2.free = 1
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select seat_id
from(
select seat_id, free,
lead(free,1) over() as next,
lag(free,1) over() as prev
from cinema) a
where a.free=True and (next = True or prev=True)
order by seat_id
```

### Easy-10. Create Session bar chart
**Concepts tested:** Subquery, CASE WHEN, UNION

**Problem:**
```
Table: Sessions

+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| session_id          | int     |
| duration            | int     |
+---------------------+---------+
session_id is the primary key for this table.
duration is the time in seconds that a user has visited the application.
 

You want to know how long a user visits your application. You decided to create bins of "[0-5>", "[5-10>", "[10-15>" and "15 minutes or more" and count the number of sessions on it.

Write an SQL query to report the (bin, total) in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Sessions table:
+-------------+---------------+
| session_id  | duration      |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 30            |
| 2           | 199           |
| 3           | 299           |
| 4           | 580           |
| 5           | 1000          |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+--------------+--------------+
| bin          | total        |
+--------------+--------------+
| [0-5>        | 3            |
| [5-10>       | 1            |
| [10-15>      | 0            |
| 15 or more   | 1            |
+--------------+--------------+

For session_id 1, 2 and 3 have a duration greater or equal than 0 minutes and less than 5 minutes.
For session_id 4 has a duration greater or equal than 5 minutes and less than 10 minutes.
There are no session with a duration greater or equial than 10 minutes and less than 15 minutes.
For session_id 5 has a duration greater or equal than 15 minutes.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
(Select '[0-5>' as bin, 
 sum(case when duration/60 < 5 then 1 else 0 end) as total from Sessions)
 union
(Select '[5-10>' as bin, 
 sum(case when ((duration/60 >= 5) and (duration/60 < 10)) then 1 else 0 end) as total from Sessions)
 union
(Select '[10-15>' as bin, 
 sum(case when ((duration/60 >= 10) and (duration/60 < 15)) then 1 else 0 end) as total from Sessions)
 union
(Select '15 or more' as bin, 
 sum(case when duration/60 >= 15 then 1 else 0 end) as total from Sessions)
```

### Easy-11. Customer placing the largest number of orders
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), GROUP BY

**Problem:**
```
Query the customer_number from the orders table for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The orders table is defined as follows:

| Column            | Type      |
|-------------------|-----------|
| order_number (PK) | int       |
| customer_number   | int       |
| order_date        | date      |
| required_date     | date      |
| shipped_date      | date      |
| status            | char(15)  |
| comment           | char(200) |
Sample Input

| order_number | customer_number | order_date | required_date | shipped_date | status | comment |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1            | 1               | 2017-04-09 | 2017-04-13    | 2017-04-12   | Closed |         |
| 2            | 2               | 2017-04-15 | 2017-04-20    | 2017-04-18   | Closed |         |
| 3            | 3               | 2017-04-16 | 2017-04-25    | 2017-04-20   | Closed |         |
| 4            | 3               | 2017-04-18 | 2017-04-28    | 2017-04-25   | Closed |         |
Sample Output

| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |
Explanation

The customer with number '3' has two orders, 
which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number '3'.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Ranking them according to the number of orders to have same rank for 
-- customers with same number of orders
With t1 as 
(
  Select customer_number, 
  Rank() over(order by count(customer_number) desc) as rk
  from orders
  group by customer_number
) 

Select t1.customer_number
from t1
where t1.rk=1
```

### Easy-12. Customers who never order
**Concepts tested:** Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Suppose that a website contains two tables, 
the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

### Easy-18. Find the team size
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY

**Problem:**
```
Table: Employee

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| team_id       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.
Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.

Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |
+-------------+------------+
Result table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |
|     3       |     3      |
|     4       |     1      |
|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |
+-------------+------------+
Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employees with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select employee_id, b.team_size
from employee e
join 
(
Select team_id, count(team_id) as team_size
from employee
group by team_id) b
on e.team_id = b.team_id
```

### Easy-19. Friend Requests 1
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), Subquery, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others’ requests as well. Now given two tables as below:
 

Table: friend_request
| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |
 

Table: request_accepted
| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |
 

Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.
 

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.
 

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|
 

Note:
The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table friend_request. In this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.
It is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case, the ‘duplicated’ requests or acceptances are only counted once.
If there is no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate.
 

Explanation: There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. 
So the rate is 0.80.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as
(
	select distinct sender_id, send_to_id
	from friend_request
), t2 as
(
	select distinct requester_id, accepter_id
	from request_accepted
)

Select 
ifnull((
        select distinct
        round((select count(*) from t2) / ( select count(*) from t1),2) from t1,t2
    ),0) 'accept_rate'
```

### Easy-26. Not Boring movies
**Concepts tested:** Basic SELECT / Aggregation

**Problem:**
```
X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema.
The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the movies’ ratings and descriptions.
Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'.
Order the result by rating.

 

For example, table cinema:

+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
For the example above, the output should be:
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select *
from cinema
where id%2=1 and description not in ('boring')
order by rating desc
```

### Easy-27. Number of comments per post
**Concepts tested:** LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, Subquery, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Submissions

+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| sub_id        | int      |
| parent_id     | int      |
+---------------+----------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row can be a post or comment on the post.
parent_id is null for posts.
parent_id for comments is sub_id for another post in the table.
 

Write an SQL query to find number of comments per each post.

Result table should contain post_id and its corresponding number_of_comments, 
and must be sorted by post_id in ascending order.

Submissions may contain duplicate comments. You should count the number of unique comments per post.

Submissions may contain duplicate posts. You should treat them as one post.

The query result format is in the following example:

Submissions table:
+---------+------------+
| sub_id  | parent_id  |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Null       |
| 2       | Null       |
| 1       | Null       |
| 12      | Null       |
| 3       | 1          |
| 5       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 4       | 1          |
| 9       | 1          |
| 10      | 2          |
| 6       | 7          |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+---------+--------------------+
| post_id | number_of_comments |
+---------+--------------------+
| 1       | 3                  |
| 2       | 2                  |
| 12      | 0                  |
+---------+--------------------+

The post with id 1 has three comments in the table with id 3, 4 and 9. The comment with id 3 is 
repeated in the table, we counted it only once.
The post with id 2 has two comments in the table with id 5 and 10.
The post with id 12 has no comments in the table.
The comment with id 6 is a comment on a deleted post with id 7 so we ignored it.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select a.sub_id as post_id, coalesce(b.number_of_comments,0) as number_of_comments
from(
select distinct sub_id from submissions where parent_id is null) a
left join(
select parent_id, count(distinct(sub_id)) as number_of_comments
from submissions
group by parent_id
having parent_id = any(select sub_id from submissions where parent_id is null)) b
on a.sub_id = b.parent_id
order by post_id
```

### Easy-32. Queries quality and percentage
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, CASE WHEN

**Problem:**
```
Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+

Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select query_name, round(sum(rating/position)/count(*),2) as quality, 
round(avg(case when rating<3 then 1 else 0 end)*100,2) as poor_query_percentage
from queries
group by query_name
```

### Easy-33. Reformat department table
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY

**Problem:**
```
Table: Department

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| revenue       | int     |
| month         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
 

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

The query result format is in the following example:

Department table:
+------+---------+-------+
| id   | revenue | month |
+------+---------+-------+
| 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
| 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
| 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
| 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
| 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
+------+---------+-------+

Result table:
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
| 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
| 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+

Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select id,
sum(if(month='Jan',revenue,null)) as Jan_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Feb',revenue,null)) as Feb_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Mar',revenue,null)) as Mar_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Apr',revenue,null)) as Apr_Revenue,
sum(if(month='May',revenue,null)) as May_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Jun',revenue,null)) as Jun_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Jul',revenue,null)) as Jul_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Aug',revenue,null)) as Aug_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Sep',revenue,null)) as Sep_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Oct',revenue,null)) as Oct_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Nov',revenue,null)) as Nov_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Dec',revenue,null)) as Dec_Revenue
from Department
group by id
```

### Easy-34. Replace employee id with unique identifier
**Concepts tested:** LEFT JOIN

**Problem:**
```
Table: Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.
 

Table: EmployeeUNI

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(id, unique_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.
 

Write an SQL query to show the unique ID of each user, If a user doesn't have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employees table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

EmployeeUNI table:
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+

EmployeeUNI table:
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+

Alice and Bob don't have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select unique_id, name
from employees e
left join
employeeuni u
on e.id = u.id
order by e.id
```

### Easy-35. Reported posts
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, Date Functions

| action_date   | date    | 
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action such as a reason for report or a type of reaction. 
 

Write an SQL query that reports the number of posts reported yesterday for each report reason. Assume today is 2019-07-05.

The query result format is in the following example:

Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

| Mark | 
| Alex |
+------+
Explanation

According to order '3' and '4' in table orders, it is easy to tell only salesperson 'John' and 'Pam' have sales to company 'RED',
so we need to output all the other names in the table salesperson.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
# Takes higher time
# Select distinct a.name  
# from(
# select s.sales_id as sales, name
# from salesperson s left join orders o
# on s.sales_id = o.sales_id) a
# where a.sales != all(select distinct sales_id from orders o join company c on o.com_id = c.com_id where o.com_id = any (select com_id from company where name = 'RED'))

# Faster solution
SELECT name
FROM salesperson
WHERE sales_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT sales_id
FROM orders
WHERE com_id = (SELECT com_id
FROM company
WHERE name = 'RED')) ;
```

### Easy-41. Second highest salary
**Concepts tested:** Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. 
If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from employee
where salary ! = (Select max(salary)
                   from employee)
```

### Easy-42. Shortest Distance
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, Subquery, LAG/LEAD

**Problem:**
```
Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
 

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
 

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select min(abs(abs(a.x)-abs(a.next_closest))) as shortest
from(
select *,
lead(x) over(order by x) as next_closest
from point) a
```

### Easy-45. Swap Salary
**Concepts tested:** CASE WHEN

**Problem:**
```
Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. 
Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with 
a single update statement and no intermediate temp table.

Note that you must write a single update statement, DO NOT write any select statement for this problem.


Example:

| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
After running your update statement, the above salary table should have the following rows:
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Update salary
set sex = Case when sex = 'm' then 'f' 
when sex = 'f' then 'm'
end;
```

### Easy-46. Top Travellers
**Concepts tested:** LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Users

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
name is the name of the user.
 

Table: Rides

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who travelled the distance "distance".
 

Write an SQL query to report the distance travelled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by travelled_distance in descending order, 
if two or more users travelled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+

Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |

| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Elvis and Lee travelled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveller as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald didn't have any rides, the distance travelled by him is 0.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select U.name as name, coalesce(sum(R.distance),0) as travelled_distance 
from Users U left join Rides R
on R.user_id = U.id
group by U.id
Order by travelled_distance desc, name
```

### Easy-47. Triangle Judgement
**Concepts tested:** CASE WHEN

**Problem:**
```
A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.
 

However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.
 

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, 
assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.
 

| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select x, y, z,
case 
when x+y > z and x+z > y and  y+z > x  then 'Yes' 
when x=y and y=z then 'Yes'
else 'No'
end as Triangle
from triangle

### Easy-48. User Activity for past 30 days 2
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, Subquery, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Activity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website.
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
 

Write an SQL query to find the average number of sessions per user for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively, rounded to 2 decimal places. The sessions we want to count for a user are those with at least one activity in that time period.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |

| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | scroll_down   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+

Result table:
+---------------------------+ 
| average_sessions_per_user |
+---------------------------+ 
| 1.33                      |
+---------------------------+ 
User 1 and 2 each had 1 session in the past 30 days while user 3 had 2 sessions so the average is (1 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 1.33.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select ifnull(round(avg(a.num),2),0) as average_sessions_per_user
from (
select count(distinct session_id) as num
from activity
where activity_date between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27'
group by user_id) a

### Medium-1. Active Businesses
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, HAVING, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Events

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurences    | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occured at some business for a number of times.
 

Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.

An active business is a business that has more than one event type with occurences greater than the average occurences of that event type among all businesses.

The query result format is in the following example:

Events table:
+-------------+------------+------------+
| business_id | event_type | occurences |
+-------------+------------+------------+
| 1           | reviews    | 7          |
| 3           | reviews    | 3          |
| 1           | ads        | 11         |
| 2           | ads        | 7          |
| 3           | ads        | 6          |
| 1           | page views | 3          |
| 2           | page views | 12         |
+-------------+------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| business_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+ 
Average for 'reviews', 'ads' and 'page views' are (7+3)/2=5, (11+7+6)/3=8, (3+12)/2=7.5 respectively.
Business with id 1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8) so it is an active business.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select c.business_id
from(
select *
from events e
join
(select event_type as event, round(avg(occurences),2) as average from events group by event_type) b
on e.event_type = b.event) c
where c.occurences>c.average
group by c.business_id
having count(*) > 1
```

### Medium-2. Active Users
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), JOIN, Subquery, Date Functions, LAG/LEAD

**Problem:**
```
Table Accounts:

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
the id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.
 

Table Logins:

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
 

Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for 5 or more consecutive days.

Return the result table ordered by the id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+

Result table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as (
select id,login_date,
lead(login_date,4) over(partition by id order by login_date) date_5
from (select distinct * from Logins) b
)

select distinct a.id, a.name from t1
inner join accounts a 
on t1.id = a.id
where datediff(t1.date_5,login_date) = 4
order by id

)

select activity
from t1 right join t2
on t1.total = t2.total
where t1.total is null
```

### Medium-4. All people report to the given manager
**Concepts tested:** Subquery, UNION

**Problem:**
```
Table: Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his
work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
 

Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers as the company is small.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |

| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+

The head of the company is the employee with employee_id 1.
The employees with employee_id 2 and 77 report their work directly to the head of the company.
The employee with employee_id 4 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 4 --> 2 --> 1. 
The employee with employee_id 7 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 7 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1.
The employees with employee_id 3, 8 and 9 don't report their work to head of company directly or indirectly.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select employee_id
from employees
where manager_id = 1 and employee_id != 1
union
select employee_id
from employees
where manager_id = any (select employee_id
from employees
where manager_id = 1 and employee_id != 1)
union
select employee_id
from employees
where manager_id = any (select employee_id
from employees
where manager_id = any (select employee_id
from employees
where manager_id = 1 and employee_id != 1))

+---------------+---------+
(sale_date,fruit) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the sales of "apples" and "oranges" sold each day.
 

Write an SQL query to report the difference between number of apples and oranges sold each day.

Return the result table ordered by sale_date in format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |

| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |
+------------+--------------+

Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).
```
**Solution:**
```sql
Select sale_date, sold_num-sold as diff
from 
((select *
from sales
where fruit = 'apples') a
join 
(select sale_date as sale, fruit, sold_num as sold
from sales

**Problem:**
```
Table Salaries:

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| company_id    | int     |
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| salary        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(company_id, employee_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the company id, the id, the name and the salary for an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than 1000$.
24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than 10000$.
Return the result table in any order. Round the salary to the nearest integer.

The query result format is in the following example:

Salaries table:
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| 1          | 1           | Tony          | 2000   |

| 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 10800  |
| 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |
| 2          | 7           | Bassem        | 450    |
| 2          | 9           | Hermione      | 700    |
| 3          | 7           | Bocaben       | 100    |

| 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 1866   |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| 1          | 1           | Tony          | 1020   |
| 1          | 2           | Pronub        | 10863  |
| 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 5508   |

| 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 5911   |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
For company 1, Max salary is 21300. Employees in company 1 have taxes = 49%
For company 2, Max salary is 700. Employees in company 2 have taxes = 0%
For company 3, Max salary is 7777. Employees in company 3 have taxes = 24%
The salary after taxes = salary - (taxes percentage / 100) * salary
For example, Salary for Morninngcat (3, 15) after taxes = 7777 - 7777 * (24 / 100) = 7777 - 1866.48 = 5910.52, which is rounded to 5911.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as (
select company_id, employee_id, employee_name, salary as sa, max(salary) over(partition by company_id) as maximum
from salaries)

select company_id, employee_id, employee_name,
case when t1.maximum<1000 then t1.sa
when t1.maximum between 1000 and 10000 then round(t1.sa*.76,0)
else round(t1.sa*.51,0)
end as salary
from t1
```

### Medium-8. Capital Gain
**Concepts tested:** LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Stocks

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(stock_name, day) is the primary key for this table.
The operation column is an ENUM of type ('Sell', 'Buy')
Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day.
 

Write an SQL query to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.

The capital gain/loss of a stock is total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Stocks table:
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| stock_name    | operation | operation_day | price  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |

| Leetcode      | Sell      | 5             | 9000   |
| Handbags      | Buy       | 17            | 30000  |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 3             | 1010   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 4             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 5             | 500    |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 6             | 1000   |
| Handbags      | Sell      | 29            | 7000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 10            | 10000  |

| Leetcode      | 8000              |
| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') 
operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select stock_name, (one-two) as capital_gain_loss
from(
(select stock_name, sum(price) as one
from stocks
where operation = 'Sell'
group by stock_name) b
left join
(select stock_name as name, sum(price) as two
from stocks
where operation = 'Buy'
group by stock_name) c
on b.stock_name = c.name)
order by capital_gain_loss desc

### Medium-9. Conformation Rate
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Signups

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
Table: Confirmations

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
 

The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Signups table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |

| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
Output: 
+---------+-------------------+
| user_id | confirmation_rate |
+---------+-------------------+
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |
+---------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
WITH confirmation_counts AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_requests,
        SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS confirmed_requests
    FROM
        Confirmations
    GROUP BY
        user_id
),
all_users AS (
    SELECT user_id
    FROM Signups
)
SELECT
    a.user_id,
    ROUND(COALESCE(1.0 * c.confirmed_requests / c.total_requests, 0), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM
    all_users a
LEFT JOIN
    confirmation_counts c
ON
    a.user_id = c.user_id

### Medium-11. Count student number in departments
**Concepts tested:** LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY

**Problem:**
```
A university uses 2 data tables, student and department, to store data about its students
and the departments associated with each major.

Write a query to print the respective department name and number of students majoring in each
department for all departments in the department table (even ones with no current students).

Sort your results by descending number of students; if two or more departments have the same number of students, 
then sort those departments alphabetically by department name.

The student is described as follow:

| Column Name  | Type      |
|--------------|-----------|
| student_id   | Integer   |
| student_name | String    |
| gender       | Character |
| dept_id      | Integer   |
where student_id is the student's ID number, student_name is the student's name, gender is their gender, and dept_id is the department ID associated with their declared major.

And the department table is described as below:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| dept_id     | Integer |
| dept_name   | String  |
where dept_id is the department's ID number and dept_name is the department name.

Here is an example input:
student table:

| student_id | student_name | gender | dept_id |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1          | Jack         | M      | 1       |
| 2          | Jane         | F      | 1       |
| 3          | Mark         | M      | 2       |
department table:

| dept_id | dept_name   |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | Engineering |
| 2       | Science     |
| 3       | Law         |
The Output should be:

| dept_name   | student_number |
|-------------|----------------|
| Engineering | 2              |
| Science     | 1              |
| Law         | 0              |
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select dept_name, count(s.dept_id) as student_number
from department d
left join student s
on d.dept_id = s.dept_id
group by d.dept_id
order by count(s.dept_id) desc, dept_name
```

| id             | int     |
| name           | varchar |
| phone_number   | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name of a person and their phone number.
Phone number will be in the form 'xxx-yyyyyyy' where xxx is the country code (3 characters) and yyyyyyy is the 
phone number (7 characters) where x and y are digits. Both can contain leading zeros.
Table Country:

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| name           | varchar |
| country_code   | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
country_code is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the country name and its code. country_code will be in the form 'xxx' where x is digits.
 

Table Calls:

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| caller_id   | int  |
| callee_id   | int  |
| duration    | int  |
+-------------+------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the caller id, callee id and the duration of the call in minutes. caller_id != callee_id
A telecommunications company wants to invest in new countries. The country intends to invest in the countries where the average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration.

Write an SQL query to find the countries where this company can invest.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Person table:
+----+----------+--------------+
| id | name     | phone_number |
+----+----------+--------------+
| 3  | Jonathan | 051-1234567  |
| 12 | Elvis    | 051-7654321  |

+----------+--------------+

Calls table:
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| caller_id | callee_id | duration |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| 1         | 9         | 33       |
| 2         | 9         | 4        |
| 1         | 2         | 59       |
| 3         | 12        | 102      |
| 3         | 12        | 330      |

+-----------+-----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+
| country  |
+----------+
| Peru     |
+----------+
The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 102 + 330 + 330 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 8 = 9.37500
The average call duration for Morocco is (33 + 4 + 59 + 59 + 3 + 7) / 6 = 27.5000 
Global call duration average = (2 * (33 + 3 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7)) / 20 = 55.70000
Since Peru is the only country where average call duration is greater than the global average, it's the only recommended country.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select caller_id as id, duration as total
from
(select caller_id, duration
from calls
union all
select callee_id, duration
from calls) a
)
select name as country
from
(select distinct avg(total) over(partition by code) as avg_call, avg(total) over() as global_avg, c.name
from
((select *, coalesce(total,0) as duration, substring(phone_number from 1 for 3) as code
from person right join t1
using (id)) b
join country c
on c.country_code = b.code)) d
where avg_call > global_avg
```

from expressions e
join variables v
on v.name = e.left_operand 
join variables v_1
on v_1.name = e.right_operand)

select t1.left_operand, t1.operator, t1.right_operand,
case when t1.operator = '<' then (select t1.left_val< t1.right_val)
when t1.operator = '>' then (select t1.left_val > t1.right_val)
when t1.operator = '=' then (select t1.left_val = t1.right_val)
else FALSE
END AS VALUE
from t1
```

### Medium-17. Exchange Seats
**Concepts tested:** ROW_NUMBER(), Window Function

**Problem:**
```
Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
 

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
 

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
 

+---------+---------+

|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select row_number() over (order by (if(id%2=1,id+1,id-1))) as id, student
from seat
```

### Medium-18. Find the start and end number of continuous ranges
**Concepts tested:** ROW_NUMBER(), Window Function, GROUP BY, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Logs

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.

Since some IDs have been removed from Logs. Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in table Logs.

Order the result table by start_id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.
Number 9 is missing in the table.
Number 10 is contained in the table.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select min(log_id) as start_id, max(log_id) as end_id
from(
select log_id, log_id-row_number() over (order by log_id) as rk
from logs) a
group by rk
```

### Medium-19. Friend Requests 2
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, Subquery, UNION

**Problem:**
```
In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others' requests as well.

Table request_accepted

+--------------+-------------+------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
+--------------+-------------+------------+
This table holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter_id both are the id of a person.
 

Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number under the following rules:

It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.
The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same requester_id and accepter_id value.
For the sample data above, the result is:

Result table:
+------+------+
| id   | num  |
|------|------|
| 3    | 3    |
+------+------+
The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select requester_id as id, b.total as num
from(
select requester_id, sum(one) as total
from((
select requester_id, count(distinct accepter_id) as one
from request_accepted
group by requester_id)
union all
(select accepter_id, count(distinct requester_id) as two
from request_accepted
group by accepter_id)) a
group by requester_id
order by total desc) b
limit 1
```

### Medium-20. Game Play Analysis 3
**Concepts tested:** Window Function

**Problem:**
```
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+

| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |

### Medium-21. Game Play Analysis 4
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), CASE WHEN

**Problem:**
```
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) 
before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again 
on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive 
days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
```
**Solution:**
```sql
With t as 
(select player_id,
 min(event_date) over(partition by player_id) as min_event_date,
 case when event_date- min(event_date) over(partition by player_id) = 1 then 1 
 else 0 
 end as s
 from Activity)

select round(sum(t.s)/count(distinct t.player_id),2) as fraction 
from t
```

### Medium-22. Get highest answer rate question
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Get the highest answer rate question from a table survey_log with these columns: id, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp.

id means user id; action has these kind of values: "show", "answer", "skip"; answer_id is not null when action column is "answer", 
while is null for "show" and "skip"; q_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.

Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.

Example:

Input:
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| id   | action    | question_id  | answer_id  | q_num     | timestamp  |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| 5    | show      | 285          | null       | 1         | 123        |
| 5    | answer    | 285          | 124124     | 1         | 124        |
| 5    | show      | 369          | null       | 2         | 125        |
| 5    | skip      | 369          | null       | 2         | 126        |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| survey_log  |
+-------------+
|    285      |
+-------------+
Explanation:
question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.
 

Note: The highest answer rate meaning is: answer number's ratio in show number in the same question.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select a.question_id, coalesce(b.answer/a.show_1,0) as rate
from 
(select question_id, coalesce(count(*),0) as show_1
from survey_log
where action != 'answer'
group by question_id) a
left join
(select question_id, coalesce(count(*),0) as answer
from survey_log
where action = 'answer'
group by question_id) b
on a.question_id = b.question_id)

select a.question_id as survey_log
from 
( select t1.question_id,
rank() over(order by rate desc) as rk
from t1) a
where a.rk = 1
```

### Medium-23. Get the second most recent activity
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), Window Function, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: UserActivity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| username      | varchar |
| activity      | varchar |
| startDate     | Date    |
| endDate       | Date    |
+---------------+---------+
This table does not contain primary key.
This table contain information about the activity performed of each user in a period of time.
A person with username performed a activity from startDate to endDate.

Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one. 

A user can't perform more than one activity at the same time. Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

UserActivity table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-12  | 2020-02-20  |
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-24  | 2020-02-28  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

The most recent activity of Alice is Travel from 2020-02-24 to 2020-02-28, before that she was dancing from 2020-02-21 to 2020-02-23.
Bob only has one record, we just take that one.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select username, activity, startdate, enddate
from
(select *,
rank() over(partition by username order by startdate desc) as rk,
count(username) over(partition by username) as cnt
from useractivity) a
where a.rk = 2 or cnt = 1
```

### Medium-24. Highest grade for each student
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), Window Function, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Enrollments

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key of this table.

Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest course_id. The output must be sorted by increasing student_id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Enrollments table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select student_id, course_id, grade
from(
select student_id, course_id, grade,
rank() over(partition by student_id order by grade desc, course_id) as rk
from enrollments) a
where a.rk = 1
```

### Medium-25. Immediate Food Delivery 2
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), Window Function, Subquery, CASE WHEN

**Problem:**
```
Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called immediate otherwise it's called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has exactly one first order.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+

Result table:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 50.00                |
+----------------------+
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select 
round(avg(case when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end)*100,2) as
immediate_percentage
from 
(select *,
 rank() over(partition by customer_id order by order_date) as rk
from delivery) a
where a.rk=1
```

### Medium-26. Investments in 2016
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Write a query to print the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (TIV_2016), to a scale of 2 decimal places, for all policy holders who meet the following criteria:

Have the same TIV_2015 value as one or more other policyholders.
Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e.: the (latitude, longitude) attribute pairs must be unique).
Input Format:
The insurance table is described as follows:

| Column Name | Type          |
|-------------|---------------|
| PID         | INTEGER(11)   |
| TIV_2015    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| TIV_2016    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| LAT         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
| LON         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
where PID is the policyholder's policy ID, TIV_2015 is the total investment value in 2015, TIV_2016 is the total investment value in 2016, LAT is the latitude of the policy holder's city, and LON is the longitude of the policy holder's city.

Sample Input

| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |
Sample Output

| TIV_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |
Explanation

The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select sum(TIV_2016) TIV_2016
from 
(select *, count(*) over (partition by TIV_2015) as c1, count(*) over (partition by LAT, LON) as c2
from insurance ) t
where c1 > 1 and c2 = 1;
```

### Medium-27. Last person to fit in the elevator
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Queue

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id is the primary key column for this table.
This table has the information about all people waiting for an elevator.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
 

The maximum weight the elevator can hold is 1000.

Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person who will fit in the elevator without exceeding the weight limit. It is guaranteed that the person who is first in the queue can fit in the elevator.

The query result format is in the following example:

Queue table
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name       | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| 5         | George Washington | 250    | 1    |
| 3         | John Adams        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | Thomas Jefferson  | 400    | 3    |
| 2         | Will Johnliams    | 200    | 4    |
| 4         | Thomas Jefferson  | 175    | 5    |
| 1         | James Elephant    | 500    | 6    |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+

Result table
+-------------------+
| person_name       |
+-------------------+
| Thomas Jefferson  |
+-------------------+

Queue table is ordered by turn in the example for simplicity.
In the example George Washington(id 5), John Adams(id 3) and Thomas Jefferson(id 6) will enter the elevator as their weight sum is 250 + 350 + 400 = 1000.
Thomas Jefferson(id 6) is the last person to fit in the elevator because he has the last turn in these three people.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
With t1 as
(
select *,
sum(weight) over(order by turn) as cum_weight
from queue
order by turn)

select t1.person_name
from t1
where turn = (select max(turn) from t1 where t1.cum_weight<=1000)
```

### Medium-28. Managers with atleast 5 direct reports
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), GROUP BY

**Problem:**
```
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
Note:
No one would report to himself.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as
(
    select managerid, count(name) as total
    from employee
    group by managerid
)

select e.name
from t1
join employee e
on t1.managerid = e.id
where t1.total>=5
```

| state          | enum    |
| amount         | int     |
| trans_date     | date    |
+----------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].
Table: Chargebacks

| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| trans_id       | int     |
| charge_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
Chargebacks contains basic information regarding incoming chargebacks from some transactions placed in Transactions table.
trans_id is a foreign key to the id column of Transactions table.
Each chargeback corresponds to a transaction made previously even if they were not approved.
 

Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of approved transactions and their total amount, the number of chargebacks and their total amount.

Note: In your query, given the month and country, ignore rows with all zeros.

The query result format is in the following example:

Transactions table:
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| id   | country | state    | amount | trans_date |
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| 101  | US      | approved | 1000   | 2019-05-18 |

| 7    | 2020   | 30     |
| 13   | 2019   | 40     |
+------+--------+--------+

The npv value of (7, 2018) is not present in the NPV table, we consider it 0.
The npv values of all other queries can be found in the NPV table.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select q.id, q.year, coalesce(n.npv,0) as npv
from queries q
left join npv n
on q.id = n.id and q.year=n.year
```

### Medium-34. New users daily count
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), GROUP BY

**Problem:**
```
Table: Traffic

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| activity      | enum    |
| activity_date | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity column is an ENUM type of ('login', 'logout', 'jobs', 'groups', 'homepage').
 

Write an SQL query that reports for every date within at most 90 days from today, 
the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.

The query result format is in the following example:

Traffic table:
+---------+----------+---------------+
| user_id | activity | activity_date |
+---------+----------+---------------+
| 1       | login    | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | homepage | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | logout   | 2019-05-01    |
| 2       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 2       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 3       | login    | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | jobs     | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | logout   | 2019-01-01    |
| 4       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | groups   | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
+---------+----------+---------------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------+
| login_date | user_count  |
+------------+-------------+
| 2019-05-01 | 1           |
| 2019-06-21 | 2           |
+------------+-------------+
Note that we only care about dates with non zero user count.
The user with id 5 first logged in on 2019-03-01 so he's not counted on 2019-06-21.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as
(
    select user_id, min(activity_date) as login_date
    from Traffic
    where activity = 'login'
    group by user_id
)

select login_date, count(distinct user_id) as user_count
from t1
where login_date between '2019-04-01' and '2019-06-30'
group by login_date
```

### Medium-35. Nth Highest salary
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), Window Function, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```
**Solution:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select distinct a.salary
      from
      (select salary, 
      dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as rk
      from Employee) a
      where a.rk = N
  );
END

  
## Approach 2: Use of Limit and Offset

Create Function getNthHighestSalary(N INT) Returns INT
Begin
  
  Set N = N-1;
  Return
    
    Select distinct salary
    From Employee
    Order By salary Desc
    Limit 1 Offset N
    
End;
```

### Medium-36. Page Recommnedations

### Medium-39. Project Employees 3
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), Window Function, CTE (WITH clause)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+

Write an SQL query that reports the most experienced employees in each project. 
In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years.

The query result format is in the following example:

Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |

| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 3                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | employee_id   |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 1           | 3             |
| 2           | 1             |
+-------------+---------------+
Both employees with id 1 and 3 have the 
most experience among the employees of the first project. For the second project, the employee with id 1 has the most experience.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select p.project_id, p.employee_id, e.experience_years,
rank() over(partition by project_id order by experience_years desc) as rk
from project p
join employee e
on p.employee_id = e.employee_id)

select t1.project_id, t1.employee_id
from t1
where t1.rk = 1
```

### Medium-40. Rank scores
**Concepts tested:** RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), Window Function

**Problem:**
```
Write a SQL query to rank scores.
If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. 
Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. 
In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
Important Note: For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, 
you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example `Rank`.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select Score,
dense_rank() over(order by score desc) as "Rank"
from scores
```

### Medium-41. Rectangles Area
**Concepts tested:** Self Join, JOIN

**Problem:**
```
Table: Points

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| x_value       | int     |
| y_value       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each point is represented as a 2D Dimensional (x_value, y_value).
Write an SQL query to report of all possible rectangles which can be formed by any two points of the table. 

Each row in the result contains three columns (p1, p2, area) where:

p1 and p2 are the id of two opposite corners of a rectangle and p1 < p2.
Area of this rectangle is represented by the column area.
Report the query in descending order by area in case of tie in ascending order by p1 and p2.

Points table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| id       | x_value     | y_value     |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 1        | 2           | 8           |
| 2        | 4           | 7           |
| 3        | 2           | 10          |
+----------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| p1       | p2          | area        |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 2        | 3           | 6           |
| 1        | 2           | 2           |
+----------+-------------+-------------+

p1 should be less than p2 and area greater than 0.
p1 = 1 and p2 = 2, has an area equal to |2-4| * |8-7| = 2.
p1 = 2 and p2 = 3, has an area equal to |4-2| * |7-10| = 6.
p1 = 1 and p2 = 3 It's not possible because the rectangle has an area equal to 0.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select p1.id as p1, p2.id as p2, abs(p1.x_value-p2.x_value)*abs(p1.y_value-p2.y_value) as area
from points p1 cross join points p2
where p1.x_value!=p2.x_value and p1.y_value!=p2.y_value and p1.id<p2.id
order by area desc, p1, p2
```

### Medium-42. Reported Posts 2
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Actions

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    |
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action such as a reason for report or a type of reaction. 
Table: Removals

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| post_id       | int     |
| remove_date   | date    | 
+---------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that some post was removed as a result of being reported or as a result of an admin review.
 

Write an SQL query to find the average for daily percentage of posts that got removed after being reported as spam, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+

Result table:
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts was removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select a.action_date, (count(distinct r.post_id)+0.0)/(count(distinct a.post_id)+0.0) as result
from (select action_date, post_id
from actions
where extra = 'spam' and action = 'report') a
left join
removals r
on a.post_id = r.post_id
group by a.action_date)

select round(avg(t1.result)*100,2) as  average_daily_percent
from t1
```

### Medium-45. Second degree follower
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each follower’s follower if he/she has one.

For example:

+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
should output:
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
Explaination:
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.
 

Note:
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select followee as follower, count(distinct(follower)) as num
from follow
where followee = any(select follower from follow)
group by followee
order by followee
```

### Medium-46. Shortest distance in a plane
**Concepts tested:** Self Join, JOIN, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 

| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
 

The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 

| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
 

Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select round(a.shortest,2) as shortest
from(
select sqrt(pow((p1.x-p2.x),2)+pow((p1.y-p2.y),2)) as shortest
from point_2d p1
cross join point_2d p2
where p1.x!=p2.x or p1.y!=p2.y
order by sqrt(pow((p1.x-p2.x),2)+pow((p1.y-p2.y),2))
limit 1) a
```

### Medium-47. Team scores in football match
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery, UNION, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Teams

+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |
+---------------+----------+
team_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table represents a single football team.
Table: Matches

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     | 
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams. 
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the teams table (team_id) and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals respectively.
 

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
A team receives three points if they win a match (Score strictly more goals than the opponent team).
A team receives one point if they draw a match (Same number of goals as the opponent team).
A team receives no points if they lose a match (Score less goals than the opponent team).
Write an SQL query that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches. Result table should be ordered by num_points (decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the records by team_id (increasing order).

The query result format is in the following example:

Teams table:
+-----------+--------------+
| team_id   | team_name    |
+-----------+--------------+
| 10        | Leetcode FC  |
| 20        | NewYork FC   |

### Medium-48. Tree Node
**Concepts tested:** GROUP BY, Subquery, CASE WHEN, IN Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Given a table tree, id is identifier of the tree node and p_id is its parent node's id.

+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
 

Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:
 

+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+
 

Explanation

 

Node '1' is root node, because its parent node is NULL and it has child node '2' and '3'.
Node '2' is inner node, because it has parent node '1' and child node '4' and '5'.
Node '3', '4' and '5' is Leaf node, because they have parent node and they don't have child node.

And here is the image of the sample tree as below:
 

			  1
			/   \
          2       3
        /   \
      4       5
Note

If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select id,
case when p_id is null then 'Root'
when id not in (select p_id from tree where p_id is not null group by p_id) then 'Leaf'
else 'Inner'
end as Type
from tree
order by id
```

| 2         | "28 Letters"       |
| 5         | "The Hunger Games" |
+-----------+--------------------+
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select b.book_id, name
from
(select *
from books
where available_from < '2019-05-23') b
left join
(select *
from orders 
where dispatch_date > '2018-06-23') a
on a.book_id = b.book_id
group by b.book_id, name
having coalesce(sum(quantity),0)<10

## 🔴 Hard Questions
<a id="hard-questions"></a>

### Hard-1. Average Salary
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), JOIN, CASE WHEN

**Problem:**
```
Given two tables as below, write a query to display the comparison result (higher/lower/same) of the 
average salary of employees in a department to the company's average salary.
 

Table: salary
| id | employee_id | amount | pay_date   |
|----|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1  | 1           | 9000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 2  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 3  | 3           | 10000  | 2017-03-31 |
| 4  | 1           | 7000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 5  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 6  | 3           | 8000   | 2017-02-28 |
 

The employee_id column refers to the employee_id in the following table employee.
 

| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 2             |
| 3           | 2             |
 

So for the sample data above, the result is:
 

| pay_month | department_id | comparison  |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2017-03   | 1             | higher      |
| 2017-03   | 2             | lower       |
| 2017-02   | 1             | same        |
| 2017-02   | 2             | same        |
 

Explanation
 

In March, the company's average salary is (9000+6000+10000)/3 = 8333.33...
 

The average salary for department '1' is 9000, which is the salary of employee_id '1' since there is only one employee in this department. So the comparison result is 'higher' since 9000 > 8333.33 obviously.
 

The average salary of department '2' is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of employee_id '2' and '3'. So the comparison result is 'lower' since 8000 < 8333.33.
 

With he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is 'same' since both the department '1' and '2' have the same average salary with the company, which is 7000.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select date_format(pay_date,'%Y-%m') as pay_month, department_id, avg(amount) over(partition by month(pay_date),department_id) as dept_avg, 
avg(amount) over(partition by month(pay_date)) as comp_avg
from salary s join employee e
using (employee_id))

select distinct pay_month, department_id, 
case when dept_avg>comp_avg then "higher"
when dept_avg = comp_avg then "same"
else "lower"
end as comparison
from t1
order by 1 desc
```

### Hard-2. Cumulative Salary
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, CTE (WITH clause)

**Problem:**
```
The Employee table holds the salary information in a year.

Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month.

The result should be displayed by 'Id' ascending, and then by 'Month' descending.

Example
Input

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 1  | 2     | 30     |
| 2  | 2     | 30     |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
| 1  | 3     | 40     |
| 3  | 3     | 60     |
| 1  | 4     | 60     |
| 3  | 4     | 70     |
Output

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
 

Explanation
Employee '1' has 3 salary records for the following 3 months except the most recent month '4': salary 40 for month '3', 30 for month '2' and 20 for month '1'
So the cumulative sum of salary of this employee over 3 months is 90(40+30+20), 50(30+20) and 20 respectively.

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
Employee '2' only has one salary record (month '1') except its most recent month '2'.
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
 

Employ '3' has two salary records except its most recent pay month '4': month '3' with 60 and month '2' with 40. So the cumulative salary is as following.
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select *, max(month) over(partition by id) as recent_month
from employee)

select id, month, sum(salary) over(partition by id order by month rows between 2 preceding and current row) as salary
from t1
where month<recent_month
order by 1, 2 desc
```

| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:

In IT department, Max earns the highest salary, both Randy and Joe earn the second highest salary, 
and Will earns the third highest salary. 
There are only two employees in the Sales department, 
Henry earns the highest salary while Sam earns the second highest salary.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
select a.department, a.employee, a.salary
from (
select d.name as department, e.name as employee, salary, 
    dense_rank() over(Partition by d.name order by salary desc) as rk
from Employee e join Department d
on e.departmentid = d.id) a
where a.rk<4
```

### Hard-4. Find median given frequency of numbers
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, CTE (WITH clause)

**Problem:**
```
The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select *,
sum(frequency) over(order by number) as cum_sum, (sum(frequency) over())/2 as middle
from numbers)

select avg(number) as median
from t1
where middle between (cum_sum - frequency) and cum_sum
```

### Hard-5. Find the quiet students in the exam
**Concepts tested:** Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), JOIN, Subquery

**Problem:**
```
Table: Student

+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| student_id          | int     |
| student_name        | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
student_name is the name of the student.
 

Table: Exam

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| exam_id       | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| score         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(exam_id, student_id) is the primary key for this table.
Student with student_id got score points in exam with id exam_id.
 

A "quite" student is the one who took at least one exam and didn't score neither the high score nor the low score.

Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being "quiet" in ALL exams.

Don't return the student who has never taken any exam. Return the result table ordered by student_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Student table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Jade          |
| 3           | Stella        |
| 4           | Jonathan      |
| 5           | Will          |
+-------------+---------------+

Exam table:
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| exam_id    | student_id   | score     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| 10         |     1        |    70     |
| 10         |     2        |    80     |
| 10         |     3        |    90     |
| 20         |     1        |    80     |
| 30         |     1        |    70     |
| 30         |     3        |    80     |
| 30         |     4        |    90     |
| 40         |     1        |    60     |
| 40         |     2        |    70     |
| 40         |     4        |    80     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2           | Jade          |
+-------------+---------------+

For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exam.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select student_id
from
(select *,
min(score) over(partition by exam_id) as least,
max(score) over(partition by exam_id) as most
from exam) a
where least = score or most = score)


select distinct student_id, student_name
from exam join student
using (student_id)
where student_id != all(select student_id from t1)
order by 1
```

### Hard-6. Game Play Analysis 5
**Concepts tested:** ROW_NUMBER(), Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, LAG/LEAD

**Problem:**
```
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

We define the install date of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define day 1 retention of some date X to be the number of players whose install date is X and they logged back in on the day right after X, divided by the number of players whose install date is X, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Write an SQL query that reports for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day and the day 1 retention.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+----------------+
| install_dt | installs | Day1_retention |
+------------+----------+----------------+
| 2016-03-01 | 2        | 0.50           |
| 2017-06-25 | 1        | 0.00           |
+------------+----------+----------------+
Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the
day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select *,
row_number() over(partition by player_id order by event_date) as rnk,
min(event_date) over(partition by player_id) as install_dt,
lead(event_date,1) over(partition by player_id order by event_date) as nxt
from Activity)

select distinct install_dt,
count(distinct player_id) as installs,
round(sum(case when nxt=event_date+1 then 1 else 0 end)/count(distinct player_id),2) as Day1_retention
from t1
where rnk = 1
group by 1
order by 1
```

### Hard-7. Human traffic of stadium
**Concepts tested:** ROW_NUMBER(), Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY

**Problem:**
```
X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: id, visit_date, people

Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).

For example, the table stadium:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
For the sample data above, the output is:

+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Note:
Each day only have one row record, and the dates are increasing with id increasing.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
WITH t1 AS (
            SELECT id, 
                   visit_date,
                   people,
                   id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY visit_date) AS dates
              FROM stadium
            WHERE people >= 100) 
            
SELECT t1.id, 
       t1.visit_date,
       t1people
FROM t1
LEFT JOIN (
            SELECT dates, 
                   COUNT(*) as total
              FROM t1
            GROUP BY dates) AS b
USING (dates)
WHERE b.total > 2

Write an SQL query to find for each user, whether the brand of the second item (by date) they sold is their favorite brand. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as no.

It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on a day.

The query result format is in the following example:

Users table:
+---------+------------+----------------+
| user_id | join_date  | favorite_brand |
+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2019-01-01 | Lenovo         |

| 4         | no                 |
+-----------+--------------------+

The answer for the user with id 1 is no because they sold nothing.
The answer for the users with id 2 and 3 is yes because the brands of their second sold items are their favorite brands.
The answer for the user with id 4 is no because the brand of their second sold item is not their favorite brand.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select user_id, 
case when favorite_brand = item_brand then "yes"
else "no"
end as 2nd_item_fav_brand
from users u left join

### Hard-10. Number of transactions per visit
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, UNION, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Visits

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, visit_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has visited the bank in visit_date.
 

Table: Transactions

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| user_id          | int     |
| transaction_date | date    |
| amount           | int     |
+------------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has done a transaction of amount in transaction_date.
It is guaranteed that the user has visited the bank in the transaction_date.(i.e The Visits table contains (user_id, transaction_date) in one row)
 

A bank wants to draw a chart of the number of transactions bank visitors did in one visit to the bank and the corresponding number of visitors who have done this number of transaction in one visit.

Write an SQL query to find how many users visited the bank and didn't do any transactions, how many visited the bank and did one transaction and so on.

The result table will contain two columns:

transactions_count which is the number of transactions done in one visit.
visits_count which is the corresponding number of users who did transactions_count in one visit to the bank.
transactions_count should take all values from 0 to max(transactions_count) done by one or more users.

Order the result table by transactions_count.

The query result format is in the following example:

Visits table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | visit_date |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2020-01-01 |
| 2       | 2020-01-02 |

### Hard-11. Report contiguous dates
**Concepts tested:** ROW_NUMBER(), Window Function, CTE (WITH clause), GROUP BY, Subquery, CASE WHEN, UNION, Date Functions

**Problem:**
```
Table: Failed

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
Primary key for this table is fail_date.
Failed table contains the days of failed tasks.
Table: Succeeded

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
Primary key for this table is success_date.
Succeeded table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Order result by start_date.

The query result format is in the following example:

Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |

| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+

Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |

+-------------------+


Result table:
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+

The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.
From 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-03 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-05 all tasks failed and system state was "failed".
From 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-06 all tasks succeeded and system state was "succeeded".
```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select min(success_date) as start_date, max(success_date) as end_date, state
from(
select *, date_sub(success_date, interval row_number() over(order by success_date) day) as diff, 1 as state

### Hard-16. Trips and Users
**Concepts tested:** CTE (WITH clause), LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
The Trips table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are both foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table. Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).

+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
| Id | Client_Id | Driver_Id | City_Id |        Status      |Request_at|
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
| 1  |     1     |    10     |    1    |     completed      |2013-10-01|
| 2  |     2     |    11     |    1    | cancelled_by_driver|2013-10-01|
| 3  |     3     |    12     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-01|
| 4  |     4     |    13     |    6    | cancelled_by_client|2013-10-01|
| 5  |     1     |    10     |    1    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 6  |     2     |    11     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 7  |     3     |    12     |    6    |     completed      |2013-10-02|
| 8  |     2     |    12     |    12   |     completed      |2013-10-03|
| 9  |     3     |    10     |    12   |     completed      |2013-10-03| 
| 10 |     4     |    13     |    12   | cancelled_by_driver|2013-10-03|
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+--------------------+----------+
The Users table holds all users. Each user has an unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of (‘client’, ‘driver’, ‘partner’).

+----------+--------+--------+
| Users_Id | Banned |  Role  |
+----------+--------+--------+
|    1     |   No   | client |
|    2     |   Yes  | client |
|    3     |   No   | client |
|    4     |   No   | client |
|    10    |   No   | driver |
|    11    |   No   | driver |
|    12    |   No   | driver |
|    13    |   No   | driver |
+----------+--------+--------+
Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned users (both client and driver must be unbanned) between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013. The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests made by unbanned users by the total number of requests made by unbanned users.

For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows with the cancellation rate being rounded to two decimal places.

+------------+-------------------+
|     Day    | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 |       0.33        |
| 2013-10-02 |       0.00        |
| 2013-10-03 |       0.50        |
+------------+-------------------+

```
**Solution:**
```sql
with t1 as(
select request_at, count(status) as total
from trips 
where client_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes') 
and driver_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes')
and request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
group by request_at),

t2 as
( select request_at, count(status) as cancel
from trips 
where client_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes') 
and driver_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes')
and request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
and status != 'completed'
group by request_at
)

select request_at as Day, coalesce(round((cancel+0.00)/(total+0.00),2),0) as "Cancellation Rate"
from t1 left join t2
using(request_at)
```

### Hard-17. User purchase platform
**Concepts tested:** LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery, CASE WHEN, UNION, NULL Handling (COALESCE/IFNULL)

**Problem:**
```
Table: Spending

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| spend_date  | date    |
| platform    | enum    | 
| amount      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
The table logs the spendings history of users that make purchases from an online shopping website which has a desktop and a mobile application.
(user_id, spend_date, platform) is the primary key of this table.
The platform column is an ENUM type of ('desktop', 'mobile').
Write an SQL query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile only, desktop only and both mobile and desktop together for each date.

The query result format is in the following example:

Spending table:
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| spend_date | platform | total_amount | total_users |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+ 
On 2019-07-01, user 1 purchased using both desktop and mobile, user 2 purchased using mobile only and user 3 purchased using desktop only.
On 2019-07-02, user 2 purchased using mobile only, user 3 purchased using desktop only and no one purchased using both platforms.
```
**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT p.spend_date, p.platform, IFNULL(SUM(amount), 0) total_amount, COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id) total_users
FROM
(
SELECT DISTINCT(spend_date), 'desktop' platform FROM Spending
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT(spend_date), 'mobile' platform FROM Spending
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT(spend_date), 'both' platform FROM Spending
) p LEFT JOIN

(SELECT user_id, spend_date, SUM(amount) amount, (CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT platform)>1 THEN "both" ELSE platform END) platform
FROM Spending
GROUP BY spend_date, user_id) u

ON p.platform = u.platform AND p.spend_date=u.spend_date

GROUP BY p.spend_date, p.platform
```
